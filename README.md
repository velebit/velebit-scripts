# My random scripts

This repository collects many of my random publicly available scripts. They are released into the public domain under the [Unlicense](UNLICENSE) (unless that’s not legally possible in your jurisdiction, in which case there’s a weak fallback license). But in the perhaps unlikely case that you find them useful, I’d be happy to hear about it.

## Known Bugs and Interactions

There is no organizing principle beyond “random scripts” and “publicly available”. It’s a giant hairball. Have a nice day.
